*Sentinel-2 Habitat Map (S2_Data-2016-09-13-10m)
*This is a vegetated habitat map produced by [1] at a 10-m spatial resolution in the Eastern Shore Islands of Nova Scotia, Canada. The map is the probability of vegetated habitat (0-100) and if a binary map is desired a threshold of 80% is recomended (>=80% is vegetated habitat). This was created from a Sentinel-2 image acquired on September 13, 2016 ten minutes from low tide and was classified using the methods described in [1].

Worldview-3 Habitat Map (WV3_Data-2019-08-11-2m)
This is a vegetated habitat map produced by [2] at a 2-m spatial resolution in the Eastern Shore Islands of Nova Scotia, Canada. The map is the probability of vegetated habitat (0-100) and if a binary map is desired a threshold of 80% is recomended (>=80% is vegetated habitat). This was created from a Worldview-3 image acquired on August 11, 2019 five minutes from low tide and was classified using the methods described in [2]. Note this map is the "top-performing" classification as described in [2].

Worldview-3 Habitat Map (WV3_Data-2019-08-17-2m)
This is a vegetated habitat map produced by [2] at a 2-m spatial resolution in the Eastern Shore Islands of Nova Scotia, Canada. The map is the probability of vegetated habitat (0-100) and if a binary map is desired a threshold of 80% is recomended (>=80% is vegetated habitat). This was created from a Worldview-3 image acquired on August 17, 2019 two hours to high tide and was classified using the methods described in [2]. Note this map is the "top-performing" classification as described in [2].

Processing scripts for Worldview-3 imagery (WV3_Scripts)
These are the processing scripts to classify the Worldview-3 as described in [2].
